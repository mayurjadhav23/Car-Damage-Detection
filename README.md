# Car-Damage-Detection

The manual process of car damage assessment for insurance claims is time consuming ,error prone and expensive
It requires physical inspection of the vehicle by an assessor, which can take several days and result in a backlog of claims. 
The assessment may not be accurate, leading to disputes between insurance companies and customers over the amount of the payout. 
This results in increased costs for both insurance companies and customers, as well as decreased customer satisfaction.

Our goal is to improve the car damage assessment process by implementing an automated car damage detection system that uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms to accurately and efficiently assess the damage to the vehicle.
This will result in faster claims processing, reduced costs, and increased customer satisfaction
